/**
 * Practice analytics — one place where "how is this member doing" and "how is the studio doing" are
 * computed, with no React and no provider, so C-01 (home), C-27 (practice), M-06 (member file), M-12
 * (studio analytics) and S-03 (teacher) all read the same number from the same rule.
 *
 * Everything derives from the raw tables: `bookings` × `class_sessions` (a visit = a `checked_in` booking,
 * dated by the SESSION's start, never by the booking's created_at), `memberships` (pauses, at-risk),
 * `credits` (live balances), `practice_goals` (the target). `activity_events` is a record the app
 * writes for the member's timeline; this module never reads it.
 *
 * Streak rules ("semanas de práctica", research §5 — implemented exactly):
 *  1. Weeks run Monday–Sunday in local time (the app runs in America/Bogota). Day keys come from local
 *     Date parts (`dateKey()` in format.ts), never from UTC slicing.
 *  2. A week is MET when attended (checked_in, counted by session start date) ≥ target. With target 0
 *     (no goal) no streak is computed: state 'none', count 0; weeks still carry their attended counts.
 *  3. The current week is in progress: it never breaks the streak; it counts toward it once met.
 *     State 'at_risk' = current week not met, ≤ 2 days left in it (Saturday or Sunday), count > 0.
 *  4. Rest week: one missed week per rolling 4 weeks is forgiven ("saved") provided the member attended
 *     at least once in the 4 weeks before it and the run is alive (count > 0). A saved week keeps the
 *     streak but does not add to it. `graceAvailable` = no saved week in the current 4-week window
 *     (this week and the 3 before it).
 *  5. A week where the membership was paused — a `memberships` row with status 'paused' whose
 *     `paused_until` covers the whole week and whose pause began (updated_at) before it — is skipped:
 *     it neither counts nor breaks.
 *  6. Two consecutive missed weeks, or a missed week with no grace → the run resets. State 'broken' when
 *     the break happened within the last 4 weeks and the run before it was ≥ 2; 'building' when count is
 *     0 but this week already has ≥ 1 attendance; 'alive' otherwise when count ≥ 1; else 'none'.
 *  7. `best` is the longest run in the whole history under the same rules. `count` counts met weeks in
 *     the current run (saved weeks excluded, the current week included once met).
 *  8. Changing the goal never rewrites the past (0039). A week is graded by the goal in force when it closed: the
 *     latest `practice_goals` row (by starts_on, then created_at; ended rows included) whose starts_on ≤ that week's
 *     Sunday. Weeks before the earliest goal use the earliest goal's target; with no goal rows at all every week has
 *     target 0. So a goal set mid-week governs the week it was set in and every later one, and the weeks already
 *     lived keep the target they were lived under (`PracticeWeek.target`). A past week whose target was 0 ("sin meta")
 *     resets the run without counting as a break. `target`, `hasGoal` and `thisWeek` are the current active goal.
